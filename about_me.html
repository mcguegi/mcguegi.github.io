                                    <li>I am currently working in the area of Invoice by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, which is responsible for enhancing the invoicing experience for Amazon Business customers by providing a unified invoice supplier. As a member of the Compliance, Accounting, and Payments team, I have been involved in several crucial projects, including the successful launch of IBA in the EU and Indian marketplaces.

My responsibilities included designing and developing tools, libraries, and services to monitor production models. Through my work, I ensured that our models were performing at their best, providing the best possible experience for our users.</li>

Notably, I was responsible for integrating a new payment method into the application, specifically for CODENSA credit cards.

In my role, I was responsible for developing software solutions to improve the functionality of the accounting systems, as well as providing technical support to ensure their efficient operation. This experience allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the intersection between technology and accounting, and the importance of user-centered design in creating effective solutions.</a>)

                                    <li>My passion for education was further strengthened when I had the opportunity to serve as a tutor at my university. During my time as a tutor, I taught courses in Basic Programming and Object-Oriented Programming, sharing my knowledge and skills with eager learners. In addition, I was also involved in the development of the Engineering Faculty Dean's page, making important updates and improvements to ensure that it was providing the most valuable information to students and faculty members. Through my work as a tutor and developer, I gained invaluable experience in the field of education and technology, and a deep appreciation for the role that technology can play in facilitating learning and collaboration.</li>
